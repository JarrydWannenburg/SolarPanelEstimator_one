# SolarPanelEstimator_one

With this estimator, users specify details of a solar panel system, and the calculator will estimate the optimal number of panels to install by minimizing the electricity cost for a given location. The single period optimization doesn't recognize rising costs when optimizing, which led to the creation of the multi period version of this calculator. The associated grid purchase costs and generated electricity are estimated as well. This calculator is useful when looking to install a solar system, but users should default to the multi period version.

This version of the estimator is what I had finished by the end of my assistantship.
